# How to AI

1) What REAL WORLD PHENOMENA in form of ENTITIES (datasets or clusters of datasets) do I want to IDENTIFY, GENERATE, PROJECT on past/future with, or what hypotheses about them do I want FALSIFY to generate PROFIT?  

2) What DATA (STRUCTURE) do I need and how do I get it clean and structured?  

3) What is the most ROBUST and CURRENT TECH STACK to facilitate (1) and (2) for the long term and repeatedly (BOILERPLATE)?  

4) What are the KEY AI PARADIGMS and how are they written IN OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES?  

5) Did I generate a PROFIT precisely because of my ASSUMPTIONS in (1)? Can I improve (2), (3), (4) or should I start fresh?
